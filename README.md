This program includes examples of searching and sorting algorithms in action. They are not 100% accurate, but they should provide you with an idea of how they work in action.

Searches included: binary search, linear search
Sorts included: insertion sort, bubble sort

Merge sort and quick sort are currently in development due to their complexity - stay tuned for more.
